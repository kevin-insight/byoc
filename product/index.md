# Curriculum Planning – Reinvented.

Take a virtual tour of BYOC’s most valuable technical features.

## Comprehensive Mapping

Document all aspects of curriculum district-wide. See details of lesson plans, topics and courses leading like a roadmap to achieve curriculum standards and goals. Integrated lesson planning allows teachers to plan, design and publish lesson plans in an organized structure that automatically aligns lesson content with defined learning targets. 

## Organized Framework

Enter your information into our practical and intuitive framework to achieve organization and consistency district-wide. Use filters and search capabilities to easily reference courses, topics or other details. 

## Customization

Flexible design provides framework to guide the input of your curriculum without hindering creativity to make it your own.  All information can be edited at any stage through the evolution of your curriculum at a comfortable pace.

## Share and Collaborate

The cross-district sharing tool allows you to view curriculum from other districts. Instead of reinventing the wheel, identify others’ successes and replicate them. Also, share curriculum with administrators and other teachers within your own district to ensure alignment of lesson plans with objectives, standards and assessments.

## Assess & Improve

Define, manage and analyze district-wide common assessments as well as ever-changing state and national standards. Make improvements to ensure assessments and teaching are in sync and successful plans are retained while unsuccessful or unnecessary portions are removed.

## Classroom Management
Lead discussions, make announcements, assign homework and provide educational resources to students and parents through a student portal.
