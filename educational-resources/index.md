# Educational Resources

## Ensuring BYOC Data is Current, Credible and Accurate.

[ASCD](http://www.ascd.org)  
Founded in 1943, ASCD (formerly the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development) is an educational leadership organization dedicated to advancing best practices and policies for the success of each learner. Their 160,000 members in 148 countries are professional educators from all levels and subject areas––superintendents, supervisors, principals, teachers, professors of education, and school board members.

[Common Core State Standards](http://www.corestandards.org)  
The Common Core State Standards provide a consistent, clear understanding of what students are expected to learn, so teachers and parents know what they need to do to help them. The standards are designed to be robust and relevant to the real world, reflecting the knowledge and skills that our young people need for success in college and careers. With American students fully prepared for the future, our communities will be best positioned to compete successfully in the global economy.

[U.S. Department of Education (ED)](http://www.ed.gov)  
ED was created in 1980 by combining offices from several federal agencies. ED's mission is to promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness by fostering educational excellence and ensuring equal access. ED is dedicated to: 

* Establishing policies on federal financial aid for education, and distributing as well as monitoring those funds.
* Collecting data on America's schools and disseminating research.
* Focusing national attention on key educational issues.
* Prohibiting discrimination and ensuring equal access to education.
