# Learn More About BYOC+

Attend an upcoming webinar for a closer look into BYOC+. Get an overview of our company, the philosophy behind our software, and a demonstration of the software itself – plus, opportunity for open dialogue of questions and answers along the way. Audiences who benefit most are districts looking for curriculum management solutions, or employees new to districts currently using BYOC+.

To register, simply click on the date and time of the webinar you would like to attend. Sessions are limited to the first 25 attendees, so register soon!
