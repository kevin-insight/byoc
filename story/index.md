# Built For Teachers By Teachers

## The story of how we developed BYOC.

I often refer to BuildYourOwnCurriculum as an “accidental” product. BYOC was never intended to be for sale. It began as a piece of software designed to help a frustrated school district in Wisconsin. The district hadn’t redesigned their curriculum in almost 10 years and needed to do extensive curriculum work. However, they didn’t want to do it on paper. They knew there had to be a better way. 

After a year evaluating every product on the market, they were disappointed. Everything was designed for administrators … not teachers. They felt, for any curriculum initiative to be successful, it must deliver value directly to the teacher. So, they decided to design their own solution, which is where I came in. As a software development consultant, I was hired to create a custom solution. 

To gain insight, I locked myself in a room with twelve teachers for three months. This experience was vital to the success of the project. The team of teachers was strategically assembled to help me with development. To ensure the software would be user-friendly and intuitive, the “computer challenged” teachers were selected for the design team. And to ensure we wouldn’t create another administrative system similar to what they encountered in their product search, the administrators stepped away from the development process. Knowing they could easily influence meetings, administrators attended only the kick-off meeting and final presentation of the finished product. As a result, I can tell you, BYOC truly was designed by teachers for teachers. It may sound cliché, but in this case, it’s true. I was there.

At the completion of the project, like any good consultant, I left the school. Then the unexpected happened. My phone started ringing, and kept ringing for the next three years. Other districts saw what we created and wanted to replicate it in their schools. I left the consulting company and started School Software Group to help more school districts around the country with their curriculum and assessment management needs. And today, that is all we do.

## Core Beliefs

BYOC was founded on a series of basic beliefs about curriculum established by teachers. These beliefs continue to serve as the foundation and guiding principles behind the continuous development and implementation of our product.

* Curriculum must be a living tool for learning. It cannot be created/revised every five years and then placed upon a shelf never to be seen again for another five years. 
* Curriculum must be standards-based (local, state, national) and this alignment between the standards and curriculum must be easily verified. 
* Curriculum must serve as a foundation for building collaborative culture. 
* We must overcome the tradition of teacher isolation. The focus of teachers must go beyond their classroom.
* Teachers are not always good at sharing ideas/activities. We need to find a way to allow teachers to easily share ideas/activities with other teachers. 
* Curriculum must be easily developed, easily accessible, and time friendly. 
* Curriculum must be of value to all audiences (students, parents/community, teachers, administrators, & school board), and able to enhance classroom instruction, improve student learning, and serve as the catalyst for addressing the needs of all students.
