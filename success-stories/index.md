# Proven Powerful

Hear directly from teachers, principles and administrators how BYOC has changed their approach to curriculum and improved communication, lesson planning and assessment district-wide.

> "BYOC is a powerful communication and accountability tool. All educators recognize the gap between the written curriculum and taught curriculum and struggle with the resulting problems. By putting K-12 curriculum at the fingertips of every teacher in the district, staff has access to all content areas, making integration, differentiation, and accountability for key concepts and pacing obvious. The level of conversation is elevated, focusing on meeting individual needs of students while ensuring equity of opportunity. It brings everyone to the same page."
>
>**– Pat Deklotz, Superintendent**

> "We pursued three elusive goals until our work with BYOC software provided us with a successful resolution. We needed 1) a "standards-up" curriculum writing tool to assure that our instruction was aligned with an array of national, state and local standards; 2) a software tool teachers could use "anywhere, anytime" in efforts to analyze, describe and strengthen curriculum documents; and 3) software that made sense to teachers regardless of grade level or subject area. As an added bonus, instead of being an "as is" tool, BYOC has provided wonderful, continuing modifications to their product that have answered so many of our teacher's ‘I wish that our software also did this’ concerns."

>**– Dr. Stephen Seyfer, Superintendent, SCHOOL?**

> "Up until now there was no easy place for (teachers) to go and find out what the standards and expectations are for a given course. BYOC gives real credibility to what's happening."
>
>**– Marci Thiry, Kindergarten Teacher, SCHOOL?**

> "BYOC is the Cadillac of all computerized curriculum programs! Use as much or as little as you like. It is a pragmatic and systematic tool, allowing TEACHERS to create their own curricula! With teacher ownership, it is much more likely to be used throughout the school year. BYOC will not be sitting dormant in some top drawer of an unused file cabinet. Instead, it will be referred to time and time again as the school year progresses. Furthermore, BYOC bridges the gap between state standards and actual classroom practices. Before BYOC, I was frustrated because I would get to the end of the year and wonder why I hadn't covered all of my key concepts. Now, I have a clearly defined outline of my year with specific topics and concepts for each week. I feel better equipped to stay on task and feel the students will greatly benefit. I am excited about viewing other music teachers' curricula online and hope that they, in turn, will take advantage of mine."

>**– Carmen Youra, Elementary Music Specialist, SCHOOL?**

> "Children cannot learn and teachers cannot teach if they do not know the targets. A well-articulated, viable curriculum has helped to maximize student learning in our district. BYOC has helped us identify our targets for learning, which are aligned to governmental standards. It has also helped us communicate with all constituencies: teachers (including teachers from other districts), community, parents, administrators, and students. BYOC has put us all on the same page."

# Case Studies

### Park Hill School District, Missouri

Park Hill vetted five curriculum design solutions to find the development tool to best fit their needs. They used a different product in the past, but it wasn't up to date with technology. 

Director of Curriculum Dr. Jennifer Corum shared her reasoning for looking in BYOC. "In a tech-centric world, we needed a tool that was progressive and would allow us to easily make revisions as needed.” After implementing the software, she was pleased to report it’s working well for Park Hill. “We used to have our curriculum in notebooks, but now it's efficient for parents to go online and look at the curriculum, she stated. “It's in a customized template that is visually appealing and uses a common language.”

### Indiana Department of Education

In preparation for the adoption of and transition to Common Core State Standards for English/Language Arts and Mathematics, the Indiana Department of Education (IDOE) worked with 66 teachers and content experts from Indiana school districts and universities to develop curriculum maps using BYOC. The curriculum maps are available online and accessible to Indiana teachers and administrators for use as a starting point to plan their instruction.

Of the experience, Director of Curriculum and Instruction Dr. Schauna Findlay said, "Our first impression was that BYOC is very easy to use. It incorporates elements of understanding by design, provides quality, planning tools and is very easy to navigate. It has a work flow built in allowing us to deconstruct the standards into specific learning targets, then align those learning targets to units of instruction."

### Hancock Place School District, Missouri

Administrators at Hancock Place School District in St. Louis, Missouri identified the key to quality curriculum involves in-depth, time-consuming discussion and collaboration. Bringing this realization to action, Assistant Superintendent Lisa Charles decided to implement a technology tool that would help them save time and develop a successful curriculum. "BYOC+ has helped us organize our curriculum into units within a given time frame in a user-friendly format,” Charles stated. “In addition, we are in the process of developing quality quarterly assessments."

### Little Chute Area School District, Wisconsin

Serving as BYOC’s brightest example, Little Chute was among the first districts to sign up for the software after it’s creation. Previously, they used a secondary school collection tool, plus an in-house solution for mid-level primary grades. However, neither program back- or forward-mapped. Curriculum Director Jennifer McDermot found BYOC to be a solution that would house and map their curriculum across all grades.

McDermot shared her satisfaction with the level of collaboration and support offered by BYOC. "The biggest benefits of BYOC are support, ease of use, and their willingness to participate in user group meetings.” She continued, “They listen to the people who are using the product and make modifications based on needs, without destroying the integrity of the original intent."

### Pattonville School District Missouri

Short of staff and searching for a more efficient way to organize curriculum, Coordinator for Assessment and Library Services David Miller began browsing alternatives to manually fishing through hard copy curriculum guides.

After reviewing software options Miller stated, "BYOC was head and shoulders above the other options we looked at.” To Miller, there were three main reasons to choose BYOC. “Number one, it's easy to use. Two, they have a good support team who continues to deliver support to our district. And three, it meets the needs of our teachers in the classroom. They have material available at their fingertips," he said.
