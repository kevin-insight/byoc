# About School Software Group

The School Software Group (SSG) is a products and services organization headquartered in Appleton, Wisconsin. Over the past five years SSG has found itself increasingly approached by school districts, or school organizations, with projects. Through the combination of SSG's technical skills with the educational expertise of our partner districts, we have been able to create intelligent and practical software specially designed for schools.

Our approach has been to partner with educational experts in the development of solutions specifically designed to address problems districts face today.

## Our Educational Partners

**[Menasha Joint School District](http://www.mjsd.k12.wi.us)** – Partnered with SSG to create BuildYourOwnCurriculum (a curriculum development and curriculum mapping tool), Write-Track (a 6+1 Traits assessment and analysis tool) and BuildYourOwnAssessment (a district-wide assessment and analysis tool). Each of these products was originally developed to solve issues being encountered by the school district with no plan of being offered for resale.

**[Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials (WASBO)](http://wasbo.com)** – SSG and WASBO teamed together to create and offer the Wisconsin Open Enrollment Reporting and Management System (WOERMS). SSG was originally approached by a consortium of 12 districts to create this system, but, given that the information interchange aspects of the system are at their best when many districts are using it, WASBO partnered with SSG and the districts to assist in the rollout of this offering.
