      <h2>Less Paperwork, More Teaching.</h2>
      <p>Free yourself of weighty, stagnant curriculum planning and the bulky binders and paper that seem to pile up with it. BYOC uses technology to bring the teaching—and learning—experience into an evolving documented process that is easy to use, accessible anywhere, and aligned district-wide. With BYOC, teachers don’t have to recreate curriculum from scratch each year. By simply entering curriculum once, then continuously assessing and improving, educators can save time on curriculum management and shift focus to their true passion – teaching.</p>
