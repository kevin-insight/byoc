Only a select number of companies have received the District Administration Readers' Choice Top 100 Products award three times in a row! In recognizing the most innovative products, the annual award informs superintendents and other senior school district leaders about products their colleagues around the country are using to help their districts excel. The winners, selected by the magazine’s editors from a record number of nominations—exceeding 1,800—are products that received the highest number of nominations and best descriptions from K-12 leaders.
