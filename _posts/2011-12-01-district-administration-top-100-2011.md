District Administration Announces Its Readers’ Choice Top 100 Products of 2011 from a Record Number of Nominations. All Products Are Credited with Making a Difference in Education by Helping to Support Education Innovation.

The prestigious acknowledgement is given annually to K12 education products that have supported education innovation. The winners were selected by the editors of District Administration from hundreds of nominations submitted by readers, including school superintendents and district-level directors in districts across the United States. The winning products were determined by the quantity of nominations received per product, as well as an evaluation of product quality based upon readers’ nominations and explanations.

The District Administration Readers’ Choice Top 100 Products awards program provides senior district leaders with the unique opportunity to learn what products their colleagues around the country are using and how these products contribute to the success of their districts. There were a record number of nominations this year.

“The nominations offer a view into the inner workings of how districts use products to help solve particular issues,” says District Administration’s editor in chief, Judy Faust Hartnett. “The recommendations we receive include extensive descriptions from school administrators of how these products are used in their districts and the difference they have made, making it very challenging to choose only 100 products. We hope these products and their accompanying testimonials will provide a valuable resource for our readers.”
