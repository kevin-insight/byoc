This year District Administration readers nominated a record number of products that have made a positive difference in their school districts.

The annual District Administration Readers' Choice Top 100 Products award recognizes leaders in the education industry, and provides superintendents and other senior school district leaders with the unique opportunity to learn what products their colleagues around the country are using, and how these products contribute to the success of their districts.

“The record number of nominations we received this year was astonishing,” says District Administration’s executive editor, Odvard Egil Dyrli. “There were so many excellent recommendations from school administrators who shared how the products made significant differences in their districts, and choosing the Top 100 proved to be challenging and difficult. We are delighted to announce the honorees for 2012 and trust that the list will be a valuable resource for our readers.”
